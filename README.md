This hardware demonstrates a music player implemented on a DE1-SOC development board. 

After an audio file is loaded into flash memory,as well as a pair of headphones and a keyboard connected to the board, 
the song can be played and paused using the `E` and `D` buttons, respectively. The song can also play in the forward and reverse directions
using the `F` and `B` buttons, respectively. `R` is used to restart the music player. Finally, the song is sped up and slowed down
with the `KEY1` and `KEY0` buttons on the DE1, respectively.
