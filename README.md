This hardware demonstrates a music player implemented on a DE1-SOC development board. 

After an audio file is loaded into flash memory,as well as a pair of headphones and a keyboard connected to the board, 
the song can be played and paused using the `E` and `D` buttons, respectively. 
Playing the song in the forward and reverse directions is toggled with the `F` and `B` buttons.
`R` is used to restart the music player. 
Finally, he song is sped up and slowed down with the `KEY1` and `KEY0` buttons on the DE1.
The LEDs are also used as a volume indicator.
